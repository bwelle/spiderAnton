### Roof *

Documentation: The upper portion of the building envelope, including opaque areas and fenestration, that is adjacent to one conditioned or unconditioned space and that is horizontal or tilted at an angle of less than 60Â° from horizontal.

* Needs single adjacency

* Q: Is it OK if a single surface is used for the entire roof or must the roof be divided into multiple surfaces with individual surfaces for each space below the roof?
* A: All vertexes demarking a change of plane should be contiguous,

Open Studio accepts gbXML files with roofs that cover multiple spaces, but thi may cause issues with down stream analysis.
