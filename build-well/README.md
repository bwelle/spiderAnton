## Concept

Create 3D building data in a variety of shapes parametrically and export in gbXML format

## Features

This project contains a number of demo examples in the form of a programmer's 'cookbook'. The hope is that this code enables you to:

* Create simple 3D building models by adjusting a variety of numerical parameters
* Create a site context by adding, editing, saving or deleting simple forms to represent adjacent structures
* Update building models by selecting parameters from menus
* Create text reports for the geometry
* Adjust a variety of display settings
* Benefit from every menu item is its its own standalone, easy-peasy HTML file test case 


## Previous Releases

_We often think of software of software just appearing as if by magic. The reality is that software takes ongoing human effort. Click the links below and watch the progression._

## Current Issues

* 2017-10-30 ~ Need accurate area and volume calculations for spaces and building
* 2017-10-30 ~ Spaces should be numbered clockwise
* 2017-10-30 ~ No vertical spacing
* 2017-10-30 ~ Export area as single space if width less than 2 x perimeter depth plus 4'/ width of corridor
* 2017-10-30 ~ Perimeter depth should grow inward not outward
* 2017-10-30 ~ Shapes need centering
* 2017-10-30 ~ Continue fixing floor numbering issues

* 2017-10-30 ~ Make sure R12 reports page gets to speed folder

## Naming Considerations

* To help you _build well_
* A _well_ of data to help you _build_
* Primary instigator _@bwelle_


## Coding Methodology

### 2017-10-16 ~ Theo

Another big update. Last time it was the menus, this time it was the geometry handling.

The whole package now has quite a few loose ends. The next few pint releases should begin to clean things up a bit

Coming up next is

* Bring the L Shape up to the level of the Box Shape
* Work on Zones and Spaces menus
* Work on Anton's WWR menu
* Separate ft/in and metric menus. Also multiple languages maybe
* gbXML export needs rotation and overhangs 


17:13
* R11
* New geometry handling process
* 'The Building' is always in shape 
* Kicks off as a Box Shape from get go
	* Created as a JavaScript object that exists throughout session
	* Geometry can come and go, but defaults and most variables persist
	* Should make it easy to switch between shapes
* Site Settings
	* Now includes Location and Units details
	* Units not yet wired up to other menu

Mostly dealt with
* 2017-10-14 ~ Open with Box Shape already in place
* 2017-09-22 ~ Add lat & Lon

### 2017-09-29 ~ Theo

14:19
* R7.1
* Numerous minor updates following bwelle suggestions
* Adds gbXML Export preliminaries

### 2017-09-28 ~ Theo

19:09

The menu system is more robust, enables the display of Markdown format files and enables switching menu items without losing data.

It will also facilitate the development and display of the JSON and gbXML export capabilities

* R7
* Menu and file handling rebuilt
	[x] 2017-09-23 ~ Better handling of data when switching tabs after a shape has been created
[x] 2017-09-21 ~ See if perimeter depth diagonals actually add any pertinent information
	* Rule of thumb: Show what you will export and no more.
	* Currently the external wall and perimeter depth walls provide sufficient data for downstream apps. No?
[x] 2017-09-21 ~ Finish add data reporting parameters, eg openings, adjacent buildings

* build-well-threejs.html
	* delete large center axis indicator
17:01
* mnu-shape-ell-one.html
	* geometry looking good / updates well / lacks area update calculations


Need
online gbXML validator

### 2017-09-26 ~ Theo

11:12
* R6 started
* rename three.js base file
* Site context menu now settings menu and moved to bottom / update its css
* build-well-threejs.html: add view buttons / update css / set max zoom distance

### 2017-09-24 ~ Theo

12:22
* R5.2
12:36
* L Shape calculations displaying numbers as expected
13:45
* L Shape walls all display as expected
* Started adding if statements to draw permimeter depth walls when logical
[x] 2017-09-22 ~ Validate all numeric entries before updating geometries < started
[x] 2017-09-21 ~ All parameters need double checking to fix broken ones < well underway

14:28
* L Shapes have overhangs - depicted in an exaggerated fashion
[x] 2017-09-21 ~ Figure out overhangs
19:18
* We can export the Build Well models as JSON files, but - it appears - the Three.js ObjectLoader cannot - yet - import them back in as 3D models. We may have to do something about this! But it may be possible to import shapes as buffer geometry. More exploration to be done.
[x] 2017-09-21 ~ Open file often fails < better to export as gbXML...


### 2017-09-23 ~ Theo

12:31
* R5.1
* Add lots of prettifying mnu-site-context.html

15:18 ~ 
* start mnu-shape-ell-one.html r2
* 16:34 ~ ell is swell. Biting the bullet. Setting Z axis as up. 
* 17:30 ~ mnu-adjacent-buildings.html is now OK with Z up
* 19:38 ~ L shape is mostly back. Both Box and L OK with Z being up
[x] 2017-09-22 ~ Toggle rotation
[x] 2017-09-22 ~ Add background color and toggle


### 2017-09-22 ~ Theo

* 10:47 ~ Start R5
* build-well.html
	* Iframe is more full screen
	* Cut out geometry and L Shape for time being: let's get Box Shape right first
* mnu-site-context.html
	* Orientation is now input type number instead of type range
	* Added updateGridSize
	[x] 2017-09-20 ~ User can update size of grid
* 13:48 ~ mnu-box-shape.html
	* All aspects of the relevant geometry may be set from this menu
	* All menu parameters interact
		[x] 2017-09-21 ~ Floor area to update according to shape parameters
	* Wall Window Ratio now operates as desired, updates model in real-time
	* Save building data to csv files using Ben's format

Questions 14:23

* Would you define or explain overhang as used in this context? Link to authoritative illustrated reference would be cool.
* Should 'The building' offset and orientation be set in it's shape menus or in the Adjacent buildings menu?
* Should 'The building' have an offset? Or should it always have its lower left corder at 0,0?
* Should orientation of 'The building' occur at its center point or its lower left corner?
* Currently building Area and Floor Area are read only and are updated whenever length, width or number of f,oors are updated. Is this satisfactory?
 

### 2017-09-21 ~ Theo


* 11:30 ~ start r3. working on ui/css
* 12:33 ~ UI cleaned up. No more details/summary. all html files controlled from container file
	* start fixing bugs in adjacent-buildings.html
* 13:26 ~ most everything good in AB and G. Added floors, roof and internal walls to box shape. Now star L Shape

* 15:15 ~  R4 started. Box shape in its own file. Will try to replicate with L Shape
* 18:57 ~ BS * LS both operating quite well

abbreviations relate to names of HTML files; ab = adjacent-buildings.html


### 2017-09-20 ~ Theo

* 14:56 ~  Start R2
* Reobject in 'everything is a recipe' style. Using mnu-template & test-threejs basic
* 16:15 ~ 'Site Context' looking good
* 17:47 ~ adjacent buildings.html looking good
* 22:23 ~ Geometry.html is working
* 22:56 ~ Currently three separate standalone scripts
	* Makes testing and coding and understanding what's going on a bit easier
	* Currently the data is not shared between the scripts. The liaison should happen in the next release
* Also coming soon will the internal walls, adjusting window sizes and the different shapes

### 2017-09-18 

### buildings Menu

* Three buildings created by default
	* Add and delete buildings: future release
* Save file
	* Saves buildings as a single 3D object
	* All data stored in the 3D models
	* File format is standard Three.js JSON
	* Seems to be working just fine
	* Many more options will become available
* Open file
	* Works barely OK
	* building data fields are updated but edits do yet update geometry
	* L Shape models not being loaded. Try using JSON loader instead of Object loader

### Site Context Menu

* When played with after a fresh reload, mostly works just fine
* Needs error-checking and more user entry safeguards
* As mentioned above, editing is broken when opening a file


### Geometry Menu

* Mostly unfinished, only a few items work
	* Changing floor height updates some of the other fields
	* Footprint shape draws a partially parameterized L Shape - very badly
* A work in progress
