_BTW, see [README]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/README ) for why a read me filename title is upper case._

The question is: What are suitable ways for ME to maintain the data while allowing the user to change menus?

There are multiple possible responses to this question. One response might be to save the data to a local file or to a server.

The newly added save button is an incomplete initial example toward saving data between examples.
